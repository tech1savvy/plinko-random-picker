## Components of the Random Picker
1. **Ball Assignment**:
   - Each player gets a uniquely colored ball.
   - The ball represents their name and moves through the Plinko board.

2. **Plinko Board**:
   - A grid-like structure with pegs where balls can "bounce" randomly left or right.
   - The bottom row has two outcomes: "Yes" or "No."

3. **Game Logic**:
   - Balls drop one at a time.
   - A ball falling into "Yes" ends the game, selecting the corresponding player.
   - If it falls into "No," the ball is eliminated, and the next playerâ€™s ball drops.

4. **Randomization**:
   - The ball's movement at each peg is randomized (left or right).

5. **Visualization**:
   - Use colors and animations to display the Plinko board and ball movement.

## Optional Enhancements

1. **Advanced Randomization**:
   Introduce weighted randomness to simulate real-world physics.

2. **Elimination Visualization**:
   Highlight eliminated players as their balls drop into "No."

3. **Music & Sounds**:
   Add sound effects for the balls bouncing off pegs and hitting the outcome slots.
